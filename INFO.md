**_ THIS IS MY FIRST HEXLET PROJECT _**

**_ PREPARING THE REPOSITORY _**

Hexlet will create a repository named fullstack-javascript-project-44 in your GitHub account.
The repository name is important for automatic checks to work properly - don't change it.
If you accidentally delete or edit service files in the .github/workflows directory, click
the "Prepare Repository" button again to restore them. The code you wrote that is stored in
other directories will be saved when you restore it.

**_ HOW TO PASS THE PROJECT _**

Clone the repository you created to your computer with the git clone command,
and follow the algorithm for each of the next steps:

- Do the tasks
- Make 'git commit'
- Submit changes to the repository with 'git push'
- Click "Complete Step" and move on to the next step.

In the last step of the project, your code will be checked by automated tests and a linter.
